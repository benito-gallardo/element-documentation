# Using the Site Designer

We're going to design a new theme that's different from the other available themes. We will do this without having to write any code.

Our theme will use the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color pallette so that we can switch between dark and light modes with minimal changes.

## Prerequisites

Volusion Admin account

## Create a New Theme to Work with

Same as in the [Building an Element Page Tutorial](/tutorials/building-an-element-page/README.md#create-a-new-theme-to-work-with).

## Add Content

* [Gothic Ipsum](http://gothicipsum.com/)
* Pasting text without formatting

## Color Pallette

* edit header/footer to have transparent backgrounds
* Design Settings button opens Theme Style panel
* hex to copy/paste

## Typography

* Merriweather/Poppins
* update footer

## Adding More Content

* A slideshow below the text block
* Move the slideshow above the text

## Preview

* Mobile preview within Site Designer (mobile/desktop icons)
* Preview as a stand-alone temporary sharable URL (don't hit Publish, that will replace your live store)

## Other Pages

Our homepage is looking ok, now we need to review other pages on the site. For this tutorial we'll look at Product Details, because it's the most important page in on e-commerce site.

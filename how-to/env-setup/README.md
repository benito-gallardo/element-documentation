# How to Set Up your Environment for Developing Blocks

In this how-to guide, we will cover setting up your environment so that you can begin developing blocks with Element.

## Supported Platforms

Block development is supported in macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## 1. Install Node.js
If you do not already have Node.js installed, [follow the instructions here to do so](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## 2. Use the Right Node Version
You should be using Node `v8.11.3`

If you don't have [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you should install it.

Then run this command in your terminal:
```
nvm install 8.11.3
```

## 3. Install Element CLI
To install [Element CLI](https://github.com/volusion/element-cli), run this command in your terminal:
```
npm install -g @volusion/element-cli
```

## 4. Create an Account on [volusion.com](https://www.volusion.com/)
If you don't have one already, go to [volusion.com](https://www.volusion.com/) to create an account.

## 5. Log in to Element CLI
Run this command in your terminal:
```
element login
```
Then, enter the email address and password for your Volusion account.

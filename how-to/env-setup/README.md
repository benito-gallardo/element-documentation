# How to Set up Your Environment for Developing Blocks

In this how-to guide, we will cover setting up your environment so that you can begin developing blocks with Element.

## Supported Platforms

Block development is supported in macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## 1. Install Node.js

If you do not already have Node.js installed, [follow the instructions here to do so](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## 2. Use the Right Node Version

You should be using Node `v8.11.3`

If you don't have [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you should install it.

Then run this command in your terminal:

```shell
nvm install 8.11.3
```

## 3. Install Element CLI

To install [Element CLI](https://github.com/volusion/element-cli), run this command in your terminal:

```shell
npm install -g @volusion/element-cli
```

## 4. Create an Account on [volusion.com](https://www.volusion.com/)

If you don't have one already, go to [volusion.com](https://www.volusion.com/) to create an account.

## 5. Log in to Element CLI

Run this command in your terminal:

```shell
element login
```

Then, enter the email address and password for your Volusion account.

## 6. Get Approved to Develop Blocks

# Efficient Data Fetching for Blocks

In this how-to, we will show how to fetch data as efficiently as possible using asynchronous requests in JavaScript. As site speed is paramount to the end user experience, we recommend this technique.

Let's consider the following code in that might appear in `src/getDataProps.js`:

```js
export const getDataProps = (utils, props) => {
  return utils.client.categories.get().then(categories => {
    return utils.client.menus.get().then(menus => {
      return {
        categories,
        menus
      };
    });
  });
};
```

This code has room for optimization. Both `get()` calls are carried out serially even though there is no dependency between `menus` and `categories`. We can reduce the overall request latency by making both requests in parallel:

```js
export const getDataProps = (utils, props) => {
  const categoriesPromise = utils.client.categories.get();
  const menusPromise = utils.client.menus.get();

  return Promise.all([categoriesPromise, menusPromise]).then(
    ([categories, menus]) => {
      return {
        categories,
        menus
      };
    }
  );
};
```

With this simple change the `categories` and `menus` data will eacy be fetched concurrently, thus reducing latency.

Please keep in mind the following:

- Currently Element does not support async/await. You need to use promises. (This will be remedied soon.)
- When fetching data, think about the dependencies between the information you are fetching. If no
  dependency exists, fetch the data concurrently to reduce latency and exploit the fastest server side
  rendering possible.

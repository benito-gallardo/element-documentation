- Content is automatically minified, cached, and populated in CDNs for you.
- Our serving technology auto-scaled based on demand, ensuring consistently fast speeds even under heavy, spikey traffic.
- Element is [Google AMP](https://developers.google.com/amp) ready, so you can build your sites to take [advantage of AMP](https://amp.dev/about/how-amp-works/) speed. Developers can progressively add AMP support to your page by making sure you follow some [simple techniques](http://simple-amp-techniques) when developing on Element. But no need to worry, if you don't want to be AMP ready by default your sites will still be [super fast](http://keeping-sites-fast).
